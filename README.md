# Isomorphic Boilerplate

Boilerplate for isomorphic rendering using redux.

## Prerequisites
* NodeJSv7+

## Get started
`./update.sh`

## NOTES
I included some example implementations of redux state, thunk, saga and observable. Feel free to remove those.

## For front-end only development:
change history/createBrowserHistory tohistory/createHashHistory on line 4
